The web is deployed in Firebase, the source code of it can be found inside the `web` folder. There are some Firebase Functions that helps the web work, those can be found inside `functions`.

To develop in local you need node 14.x and `npm` v7 or higher. This repo uses npm workspaces. Useful commands:

- In root:
    - `npm run audit`: checks if there are any packages with security issues
    - `npm build`: builds functions and web
    - `npm lint`: lints functions and web
    - `npm run emulators`: runs firebase emulators (requires setup for storage)
- For `functions`:
    - `npm start -w functions`: starts a local Firebase Function emulator
    - `npm run watch -w functions`: transpiles files when a change is found
- For `web`:
    - `npm start -w web`: starts a local development server
